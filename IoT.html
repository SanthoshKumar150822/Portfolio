 <h3>Smart Shoe In Health Care</h3>
 <p>Predicts the walking pattern, fall detection, skeletal disorder, Knee injury, foot ulcer and other foot related diseases.
 User walks by wearing smart shoe, the force that they applied measured by force resistive sensor, accelerometer for speed and gyroscope for orientation. 
 with these values using ML model able to provide predictions or treatment suggestions regarding the condition of the feet. Medical report with
data visualization as charts and graphs send to user mail.

 <h3>Smart Security System using RFID</h3>
 <p>Provides security from unauthorized access. In Malls, Banks, Museum, MNC, Government Office,
 Industry, Universities, Research center and Labs restricted areas are there, to enter into the 
room, need special access only authorized people have as an UID in RFID, when 
an user taps the RFID card in the reader if the UID matches in the list of Authorized UIDs then they will get access to enter into the room</p>

<!--Four gate-way system is introduced, LC gate is automated, when train is detected gates 
closes automaticaly and traffic signal turns into Red, if any object stuck betweeen the gates information is passed to locopilot to stop
 the train and station master to stop train which comes on the same or opposite side of track, 
informed to recovery team, fire-services, police for recovery and to file accident case and hospital for medication, if no object is detcted between the gates 
and LC gates will open once the train left the LC. this system is used to avoid level crossing accidents and to 
reduce human power and error.-->
